The good folks over at PCF World Forum have just released their first newsletter which is free of charge and can be downloaded [here](http://www.pcf-world-forum.org/newsletter/). Be forewarned, this newsletter is a teaser and if you like what you read, then you’ll want to notify THEMA1 of your intent to subscribe. This inaugural issue shares the latest news in product carbon footprinting initiatives, spearheaded by organizations like the Carbon Disclosure Project, the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol, and the German collaborative – PCF Pilot Project. In the pipeline are some events to be aware of, including the second PCF World Forum in September and a workshop on “Consistency, International Legislation, and Certification” to be hosted in Germany on July 1st.
