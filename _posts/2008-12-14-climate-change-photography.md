</div>I came across GHG Photos tonight, a site launched at the end of October that showcases the work of six photographers who are traveling the globe to visually document the effects of climate change. While many of these shots represent ‘end results,’ take a look at the winners of the [UNFCCC CDM Photo Contest](http://cdm.unfccc.int/contest/winners.html) here where users submitted photos of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. It’s not clear to me how or why the First Place finish beat out the 2nd and 3rd. Maybe it had to do with failing to deliver CERs (snare drum please).
