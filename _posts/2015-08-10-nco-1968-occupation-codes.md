The dataset we’re using refers to NCO68 occupation codes, without providing code labels. I’ve scraped what seems to be a reliable PDF with comprehensive 3-digit NCO codes and converted it to a spreadsheet for easy use in Stata or any other statistical analysis program. You can find it in the [Resources](https://pathindependence.wordpress.com/resources-code/) section and it includes 3-digit codes, occupation title, and 1-digit primary codes as separate columns.
