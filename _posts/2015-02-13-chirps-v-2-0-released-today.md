[![canvas](https://pathindependence.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/canvas.png?w=282&resize=282%2C300)](http://ewx.geog.ucsb.edu/ewx-snippets/)Today the [UCSB team](http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/) released a major update to the CHIRPS precip product that people may be familiar with from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) hazard (drought/flood) warning applications. While v. 1.8 featured global data at pentadal resolution, this update expands the daily resolution dataset from SSA to global availability. While youâ€™re there, check out their Early Warning Explorer (EWX), code snippets you can embed to produce summary stat plots and precip visualizations. Unfortunately WP prohibits JavaScript embeds, so all I can offer is a snapshot example (above) of their output.
