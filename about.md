I am a Research Economist in the International division at [Mathematica.](https://www.mathematica.org/) My research interests span rural climate impacts, urban violence reduction interventions, environmental health, and the use of geospatial data to monitor environmental change, economic development, and the effects of large-scale infrastructure projects.

and spent my formative years as a valet, a pet shop employee, a veterinary technician, an inventory specialist, a Christian bookstore employee, a spare parts driver, a university bookstore employee, a banquet server, a temporary PV installer, an intermittent custom stereo installer assistant, and a test driver of hand-built Ranger trucks rolling off the assembly line at the Ford plant in Edison, New Jersey.
